  "description": "* This homework assignment was my introduction to using Mongo.db, Mongoose, and Cheerio. * My background is in horticulture, hence the theme, and I couldn't resist the silly pun in the title. * The requirements are: - on page load, no articles are displayed - on click of a button, 20 articles are scraped from the target news website of my choice and displayed in list format - each article should have a button which will allow the user to save it - there should be a link to an endpoint which will display all saved articles - each saved article should have two buttons:  one to delete it from saved, and one to add/edit notes - the notes button should present all previously saved notes, the option to delete any of them, and a field to add a new note - there is no unique user association in this application:  all users should be able to see all notes left on a given article, and saved articles are global",
